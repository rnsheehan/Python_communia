Some thoughts on why directory names should include trailing '/'

In windows directory names include '\', e.g. c:\users\Robert\dir_name\

However, in Unix / Linux and programming languages arising from C the character '\' is interpreted
as the escape character, hence '\n', '\t' etc. For this reason when writing code 
directory names should never include '\' but only ever use '/'

c:\users\Robert\dir_name\ is not correct

c:/users/Robert/dir_name/ is correct
